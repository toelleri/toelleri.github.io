			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<font size="+1.6"> I am a final year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at George Mason University working under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://math.gmu.edu/~memelian/">Maria Emelianenko</a>. I have a Masters degree in Mathematics from George Mason University.
			   <br><br>I completed my BS in Mathematics and BA in Physics with minors in Statistics and Secondary Education from Wilkes University, Wilkes-Barre, PA in 2016.
			 <br>
			 <br>
				
				I am working on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Mathematics and Biology, specifically understanding adaptation mechanisms and using tools in data science to infer underlying dynamics and features. I have extended current adaptation criteria to include singular systems previously excluded from consideration. To motivate this extension, I prove several classes of networks emit a singular Jacobian, most notably being networks containing conservation laws. The second half of my work focuses on using techniques in data-science to infer an underlying dynamical system structure and any conservation laws present. I have worked to develop these methods such that they are robust to noise and work in a low-data environment. Using these approaches, the next steps include obtaining experimental data to infer a dynamical system model and associated conservation laws for a protein-protein interaction network. Once the dynamics have been identified, the network can be checked for adaptation.
				<br><br>During my undergraduate years at Wilkes University, I was introduced to the idea of utilizing mathematics in biology applications. I began in the field of computational biophysics where I worked on “Enhanced protein folding through confinement inside a hydrophilic nanopore” under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://www.wilkes.edu/campus-directory/del.lucent.aspx">Del Lucent</a>. For this work, we investigated the complexity of protein folding inside a cell, in particular, under confinement. Proteins are large molecules composed of one or more long chains of amino acids. Protein folding is the process in which a protein reaches its functional shape. In this heterogeneous environment, proteins can fold inside of special nanocages called chaperones, which are cone-shaped proteins that assist other proteins in folding or unfolding. Through my work, I have developed a model describing how these cages can accelerate protein folding by modifying the thermodynamics of confined water. I tested these models through distributed computing and molecular dynamics simulation and used state of the art master equation appr				oaches to analyze the results and verify my model.
				<br><br>During a study abroad in Padua, Italy, I had the opportunity to participate in the “Bench to Bedside: Translational Molecular Research” course. This course focused on the practical use of genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease. It was co-taught by faculty from US and Italy including experts in the field of medical research on topics such as leukemia, cancer research, infectious diseases, etc. The course utilized hands-on technical workshops and touched on issues related to implementation of new platforms and assays. Through both presentations and experiments, I was given the opportunity to see where the data I work with is collected, the challenges involved in this process, and a different prospective on how it is used in research.
				<br><br>In the summer of 2021, I was given the opportunity to participate as a Data Science intern at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There, I worked on using deep learning to prioritize disease targets for protein-protein interaction networks. We worked on utilizing the data in the Pharos library of known diseases and protein targets to create a ranked list of protein targets by modifying the GuiltyTargets algorithm, a machine learning algorithm that ranks protein targets using gene expression and positive-unlabeled machine learning. This work helps to shave years off the drug development process by eliminating unsuitable targets without the need for testing.
